    "    Airbnb started in 2008 and has changed the way people travel by allowing guests to stay in local homes instead of hotels. Today, it is a global platform that helps people find unique and affordable accommodations. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Airbnb dataset containing around 49,000 listings and 16 columns. The goal is to explore and understand the data to find key insights about pricing, hosts, availability, and customer behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We used Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating visualizations. The first step was to load and inspect the data to check its structure, data types, and missing values. Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, fixing data types (especially for price and dates), and handling missing values. The price column was cleaned by removing dollar signs and converting it to numeric values. Outliers were also handled so they do not affect the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the univariate analysis, we explored single columns like price, room type, and number of reviews. For example, most listings are for “Entire homes/apartments,” followed by “Private rooms.” The price distribution is right-skewed, meaning most listings have moderate prices, but a few are very expensive. Visualizations like histograms and boxplots helped us understand the overall data spread and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Next, in the bivariate analysis, we compared two variables to find relationships. For example, we studied how price changes with room type or how the number of reviews relates to the price. Boxplots showed that entire homes are usually more expensive than private or shared rooms. Scatter plots helped us see if listings with more reviews tend to have higher prices or not. These visuals make it easier to find relationships that could guide future pricing or business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In multivariate analysis, we looked at how multiple factors interact. For instance, we can analyze how price varies by room type and location together. Using correlation heatmaps, we checked how strongly numerical columns like price, minimum nights, and reviews are related. Geographical visualizations using latitude and longitude can show the concentration of listings in popular areas or tourist zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature engineering helped us create new useful columns like price per person, host experience (based on number of listings or host_since date), and availability categories. These new features make the analysis more detailed. For example, price per person allows fair comparison between listings that can host different numbers of guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We created at least five different visualizations for this project, including histograms for price, boxplots for price by room type, scatter plots for number of reviews vs price, heatmaps for correlations, and maps showing listing locations. Each of these visuals provided a different type of insight about the Airbnb market.\n",
    "\n",
    "    From the analysis, some key findings include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Entire homes are the most expensive but also the most preferred type of stay.\n",
    "    * Listings with higher reviews generally have better visibility and occupancy.\n",
    "    * Certain neighborhoods have much higher average prices due to location advantage.\n",
    "    * Hosts with more listings or longer experience tend to charge higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "    These findings can help Airbnb make data-driven business decisions. For example, they can guide hosts on pricing strategies, help identify high-demand areas, and improve guest satisfaction by promoting top-rated listings. The company can also use these insights for marketing campaigns and to encourage new hosts to join by showing successful trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In conclusion, this EDA helps Airbnb understand its market better, supports smarter business planning, and improves both host and guest experiences. The clean data, visual insights, and clear patterns discovered through this analysis form a strong foundation for future data modeling and strategic decision-making.\n"
